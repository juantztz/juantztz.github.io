abstract="In this paper we propose a 0-1 integer linear program (BILP) formulation for the open pick-up and delivery problem (PDP) with multiple origins, multiple finals and split load with a heterogeneous set of vehicles. Preliminary research has indicated that there is no an existing BILP formulation that simultaneously accounts for all the considerations implemented in this work. We also provide several experimental runs to study the performance of our formulation and provide an application of the model to solve a pick-up and delivery problem for multiple robots in an obstacle-free logistic scenario.

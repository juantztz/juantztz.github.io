My name is Juan Tzintzun. I hold BSc. in Industrial engineering
with a specialization in decision making from the University of Guadalajara and an MSc. in
Engineering Management from the University of Alberta.

My main interests are optimization under uncertainty and the interplay between operations research and machine learning. My application domains focus on supply chain management and logistics, although not exclusively. My current research projects are related to the design and analysis of planning algorithms for autonomous agents in intra-logistic applications, time series forecasting, machine learning approaches for solving combinatorial problems, and data-driven optimization for dynamic vehicle routing problems.

I have advanced experience in Python and considerable experience using Julia and Sql. I have use
optimization solvers and tools like Gurobi, GLPK, AMPL, Pyomo, Jump. Other technical strengths
include Vrep, Latex, Git, selenium, dash, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and beginner-level experience with cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services.

Currently looking for Ph.D. positions!
